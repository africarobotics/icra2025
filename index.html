One such activity was the Meet the Women in Robotics Workshop (WiRW) at the 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (R:SS) on June 23, 2019, which she presented with researchers from the U.S. Air Force Academy. The workshop was designed to raise the visibility of women in robotics, strengthen the community of female roboticists by bringing together women from various disciplines and subfields in robotics, provide opportunities for networking, and connect junior female robotics researchers to senior mentors in the field. The workshop was funded by the National Science Foundation.  </p>

        <strong>Bipedal Robotics for All: Breaking Barriers in Robotics Education</strong>
      </td>
      <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ccc; vertical-align: top; color: #00008b;">
        Bipedal robotics has seen remarkable advancements, with applications ranging from assistive exoskeletons to agile humanoid robots. 
        However, research in this field is typically restricted to graduate-level studies, creating a significant barrier for undergraduate students 
        interested in the field. In this talk, I will present my research on bipedal locomotion, including a novel control approach based on 
        the Angular Momentum Linear Inverted Pendulum (ALIP) model, which extends existing techniques to enable dynamic stair climbing.<br><br>
        I will also introduce <strong>Biped Bootcamp</strong>, an educational program designed to bridge this gap by providing structured, 
        accessible coursework that brings bipedal robotics concepts to freshmen undergraduates. By integrating fundamental modeling and 
        control principles with hands-on learning, this new curriculum will equip students with the skills needed to engage with bipedal 
        robotics early in their academic careers. Through this talk, I will demonstrate how making advanced robotics concepts more 
        accessible can inspire the next generation of roboticists and drive innovation in the field.

        <strong>Cultivating the Future: Robots, Models, and Agents to Unlock African Agricultural Potential</strong>
      </td>
      <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ccc; vertical-align: top; color: #00008b;">
        The African continent has the highest percentage of its population employed directly in agriculture and the highest percentage of arable land. 
        However, its food reserves have always been threatened by short-term weather volatility and recently the long-term effects of climate change. 
        To meet the rising food needs, it is critical that the productivity of the agricultural sector be increased. In this talk we will discuss a collaborative 
        approach combining state-of-the-art robotic techniques to African Agriculture which we believe could be useful in unlocking the potential of African agriculture.

        <strong>Sustainable Pathways for African Robotics: Balancing On-Device Intelligence and Cloud Synergy</strong>
      </td>
      <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ccc; vertical-align: top; color: #00008b;">
        The advancement of robotics in Africa presents a unique opportunity to address critical challenges across diverse sectors. While cloud-supported artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention, its reliance on consistent connectivity and substantial infrastructure poses limitations for sustainable and widespread adoption across the continent. This talk advocates for a strategic approach that emphasizes algorithm-oriented on-device intelligence as a foundational element, complemented by selective and efficient utilization of cloud resources.
        Drawing upon the speaker's research in topology-guided motion planning as an example of advanced on-device algorithmic solutions, the talk will illustrate how focusing on efficient onboard intelligence can drive innovation through a balanced hybrid strategy, promoting local expertise, open-source collaboration, and the development of contextually relevant applications.

        <strong>Africa, Leapfrog + Robots: The Case for Robotics Research and Education in Africa</strong>
      </td>
      <td style="padding: 12px; border: 1px solid #ccc; vertical-align: top; color: #00008b;">
        Africa is the fastest growing continent by population in the world and is also home to the youngest population in the world, with an average population age of ~19. With a current population of over 1.5 Billion people, the question is how will compute resources meet the increasing demands of Africa's digital transformation. Africa has benefited from several technology leapfrog events ranging from mobile phones instead of landlines, to digital mobile payments instead of payment card readers. For the robotics revolution in Africa, the role of edge computing and cloud computing may differ based on the contexts and opportunities. Generative AI is already playing a critical role across the continent ranging from education delivery and customization to healthcare. This talk will explore the current state of robotics affairs in Africa, as well as future trends and opportunities.
