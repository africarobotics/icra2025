    <h3>Dr. Oluwami (Wami) Dosunmu-Ogunbi</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Oluwami (Wami) Dosunmu-Ogunbi is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at 
      Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and will join Ohio Northern University as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical 
      Engineering in Fall 2025. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics at the University of Michigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her research focuses on controls with applications in bipedal locomotion and engineering education. During her Ph.D., 
      she developed the Biped Bootcamp technical document, which she is transforming into a two-tier undergraduate curriculum—
      introducing first- and second-year students to bipedal robotics while providing advanced coursework for juniors and seniors. 
      She is also developing a hardware teaching platform to complement these courses, bridging the gap between theoretical learning 
      and hands-on experience.

    <h2 style="font-size: 22px; color: #34495e;">Bipedal Robotics for All: Breaking Barriers in Robotics Education</h2>

    <h1 style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 30px;">Abstract:</h1>
    <p>
      Bipedal robotics has seen remarkable advancements, with applications ranging from assistive exoskeletons to agile humanoid robots. 
      However, research in this field is typically restricted to graduate-level studies, creating a significant barrier for undergraduate students 
      interested in the field. In this talk, I will present my research on bipedal locomotion, including a novel control approach based on 
      the Angular Momentum Linear Inverted Pendulum (ALIP) model, which extends existing techniques to enable dynamic stair climbing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I will also introduce <strong>Biped Bootcamp</strong>, an educational program designed to bridge this gap by providing structured, 
      accessible coursework that brings bipedal robotics concepts to freshmen undergraduates. By integrating fundamental modeling and 
      control principles with hands-on learning, this new curriculum will equip students with the skills needed to engage with bipedal 
      robotics early in their academic careers. Through this talk, I will demonstrate how making advanced robotics concepts more 
      accessible can inspire the next generation of roboticists and drive innovation in the field.

    <h3>Conrad Tucker</h3>
    <p>
      Conrad Tucker is the director of CMU-Africa and associate dean for international affairs-Africa, as well as a professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. He holds courtesy faculty appointments in machine learning, robotics, and biomedical engineering. His research focuses on the design and optimization of systems through the acquisition, integration, and mining of large scale, disparate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tucker has served as PI/Co-PI on federally/non-federally funded grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the Office of Naval Research (ONR) via the NSF Center for eDesign, and the Gates Foundation. In February 2016, he was invited by National Academy of Engineering (NAE) President Dr. Dan Mote, to serve as a member of the Advisory Committee for the NAE Frontiers of Engineering Education (FOEE) Symposium. He received his Ph.D., M.S. (industrial engineering), and MBA degrees from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and his B.S. in mechanical engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

                    <p> Dr. Chinwe Ekenna is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University at Albany, State University of New York, and the <a href = "https://www.albany.edu/computer-science/faculty/chinwe-ekenna" class="director-link">Director of the Robotics, Algorithm and Computable Systems (RACS) Laboratory.</a> Dr. Ekenna is a faculty advisor for UAlbany's student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery-Women (ACM-W) and participates in publicly engaged activities which encourage young women in STEM. One such activity was the Meet the Women in Robotics Workshop (WiRW) at the 2019 Robotics: Science and Systems Conference (R:SS) on June 23, 2019, which she presented with researchers from the U.S. Air Force Academy. The workshop was designed to raise the visibility of women in robotics, strengthen the community of female roboticists by bringing together women from various disciplines and subfields in robotics, provide opportunities for networking, and connect junior female robotics researchers to senior mentors in the field. The workshop was funded by the National Science Foundation.  </p>

                    <h3>Dr. Paul Amayo</h3>
                    <p> Dr Paul Amayo is a Senior Lecturer and Principal Investigator in the African Robotics Unit at the University of Cape Town. He has broad experience in both hardware and software development over various sectors (from self-driving cars in the UK to paratransit in Kenya) with a primary focus on robotics. He has Dphil in Engineering Science from the Oxford Robotics Institute, University of Oxford. Paul strongly believes that technology holds the key to solving some of the world's and in particular Africa's most pressing problems. His interests are therefore not only in advancement of technology through research but also in its subsequent education that ensures that this technology is adopted into communities where it would do the most good. </p>

                    <h3>Dr. Oluwami (Wami) Dosunmu-Ogunbi</h3>
                    <p> Dr. Oluwami (Wami) Dosunmu-Ogunbi is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and will join Ohio Northern University as an Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering in Fall 2025. She completed her Ph.D. in Robotics at the University of Michigan.

Her research focuses on controls with applications in bipedal locomotion and engineering education. During her Ph.D., she developed the Biped Bootcamp technical document, which she is transforming into a two-tier undergraduate curriculum—introducing first- and second-year students to bipedal robotics while providing advanced coursework for juniors and seniors. She is also developing a hardware teaching platform to complement these courses, bridging the gap between theoretical learning and hands-on experience.

Dr. Ogunbi is also a sought-after speaker, delivering talks on robotics, diversity in STEM, and overcoming adversity, including a TEDx talk at TEDxDetroit. More about her work and speaking engagements can be found at https://wamiogunbi.com. </p>
